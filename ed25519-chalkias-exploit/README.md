# ed25519-chalkias-exploit in Rust

Demonstration tool of the chalkias-EdDSA api vulnerability exploit, where signing function could accept a non-matching public-private key pair. The tests are based on the ed25519-dalek (version 1.0.1, as latest version has fixed the issue) and show how to extract the private key by requesting two signatures over the same message, but by providing a different public key as input.
